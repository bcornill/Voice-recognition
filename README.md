# Voice recognition

Based on a dataset of 5 different speakers pronouncing numbers repeatedly, we develop a voice recognition tool using LPC coefficients, an elastic distance and K-nearest neighbors algorithm.

The efficiency of the model is then computed for different initialization of the training and testing datasets.
